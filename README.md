## Section 1: Java Fundamentals

### 1.1 Understanding Java

Java is a widely-used programming language known for its simplicity, portability, and versatility. In this section, you will learn the basics of Java, including its features, history, and advantages as a language.

### 1.2 Setting up the Development Environment

To start programming in Java, you need to set up your development environment. In this section, we'll guide you through the process of installing the JDK (Java Development Kit) and configuring your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for a smooth development experience.

#### Installing JDK 11 from Adoptium

To install JDK 11 from Adoptium, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Adoptium website](https://adoptium.net/) and navigate to the downloads page.
2. Select the appropriate JDK 11 distribution for your operating system.
3. Download the installer package and run it.
4. Follow the installation wizard instructions to complete the JDK installation.

#### Configuring Intellij IDEA Community Edition

Intellij IDEA is a popular IDE for Java development. In this guide, we'll use Intellij IDEA Community Edition. To configure Intellij IDEA for Java development, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [Intellij IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
2. Launch Intellij IDEA after the installation is complete.

#### Setting up a New Project in Intellij IDEA

Once you have Intellij IDEA installed, you can set up a new Java project. Here's how:

1. Open Intellij IDEA and click on "Create New Project" or go to "File" > "New" > "Project".
2. Select "Java" in the left pane and ensure that JDK 11 is selected as the Project SDK.
3. Choose the desired project template and click "Next".
4. Enter the project name and select the project location on your computer.
5. Click "Finish" to create the project.

#### Understanding build.gradle in both Kotlin (KTS) and Groovy

In Java projects, build.gradle files are commonly used for project configuration and dependency management. There are two syntax options for writing build.gradle files: Kotlin (KTS) and Groovy.

##### Kotlin (KTS) Syntax

The Kotlin DSL (KTS) provides a more concise and type-safe syntax for build.gradle files. It is recommended for new projects. Here's an example of a build.gradle.kts file:

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts (Kotlin DSL)
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.5.20"
}

group = "com.example"
version = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation(kotlin("stdlib-jdk8"))
    testImplementation(kotlin("test"))
}
```

##### Groovy Syntax

The Groovy syntax is the traditional syntax for build.gradle files and is still widely used. Here's an equivalent example of a build.gradle file written in Groovy:

```groovy
// build.gradle (Groovy DSL)
plugins {
    id 'java'
}

group 'com.example'
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8'
    testImplementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test'
}
```

Choose the syntax that you are more comfortable with or that aligns with the existing project structure.

### 1.3 Basics of Java Syntax

In this section, you'll learn the fundamental building blocks of Java programs. We'll cover topics such as variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, and looping constructs. By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to write basic Java programs and manipulate data effectively.

#### Variables

In Java, variables are used to store data that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the program. They have a specific data type and a name. Here's an example of declaring and initializing a variable:

```java
int age = 25;
```

Data Types
Java has built-in data types to represent different kinds of values. Some common data types include:

`int`: for integer values
`double`: for floating-point values
`boolean`: for boolean values (true or false)
`String`: for representing textual data
Here's an example of using different data types:

```java
int age = 25;
double height = 1.75;
boolean isStudent = true;
String name = "John Doe";
```

Operators
Java provides various operators to perform operations on variables and values. Some common operators include:

Arithmetic operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo)
Comparison operators: == (equality), != (inequality), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to)
Logical operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)
Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (compound assignment)

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int sum = a + b; // sum = 15

boolean isTrue = (a > b) && (a != 0); // isTrue = false

int counter = 0;
counter += 1; // counter = 1
```

Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on certain conditions. The if statement is a commonly used conditional statement. Here's an example:

```java
int age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a minor.");
}
```

Looping Constructs
Looping constructs allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. The for loop is commonly used when you know the number of iterations in advance. Here's an example:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration " + i);
}
```

This is just a brief overview of the basics of Java syntax. Understanding these concepts will provide you with a solid foundation for writing Java programs and manipulating data effectively.



### 1.4 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it emphasizes the use of classes and objects to structure programs. In this section, you'll explore the key concepts of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. You'll learn how to create and use classes, define methods, and apply access modifiers to control the visibility of class members.

#### Classes and Objects

In Java, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects. An object is an instance of a class. Here's an example of a simple class and its usage:

```java
public class Person {
    // Attributes
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Method
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

// Usage
Person person = new Person("John Doe", 25);
person.sayHello();
```

#### Methods and Parameters

Methods are the behaviors of a class. They are used to perform specific actions or calculations. A method can have parameters, which are inputs to the method. Here's an example:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double divide(double numerator, double denominator) {
        if (denominator != 0) {
            return numerator / denominator;
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero.");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
int sum = calculator.add(5, 3);
double result = calculator.divide(10.0, 2.0);

```

#### Access Modifiers

Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members (variables, methods, constructors) from other parts of the program. Java provides four access modifiers:

- `public`: accessible from anywhere
- `private`: accessible only within the same class
- `protected`: accessible within the same class and subclasses
- default (no explicit modifier): accessible within the same package

#### Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. The class that is inherited from is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that inherits is called the subclass or child class. Here's an example:

```java
public class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;

    public Vehicle(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting the " + brand + " vehicle.");
    }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    private int numberOfDoors;

    public Car(String brand, int numberOfDoors) {
        super(brand);
        this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoors;
    }

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving the " + brand + " car with " + numberOfDoors + " doors.");
    }
}

// Usage
Car car = new Car("Toyota", 4);
car.start();
car.drive();

```

#### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types, as long as they are related through inheritance. Here's an example:

```java
public class Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape.");
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

public class Square extends Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a square.");
    }
}

// Usage
Shape shape1 = new Circle();
Shape shape2 = new Square();
shape1.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle.
shape2.draw(); // Output: Drawing a square.

```

#### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within a class and controlling access to them. It helps maintain the integrity and security of the data. Here's an example:

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds.");
        }
    }
}

// Usage
BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000.0);
double currentBalance = account.getBalance(); // 1000.0
account.deposit(500.0);
account.withdraw(200.0);
double updatedBalance = account.getBalance(); // 1300.0

```

### 1.5 Exception Handling

Errors and exceptions are common in software development. Java provides a robust exception handling mechanism to deal with unexpected situations. In this section, you'll learn how to handle runtime exceptions and errors using try-catch blocks, and you'll also discover how to create custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios.

#### Try-Catch Blocks

In Java, you can handle exceptions using try-catch blocks. The code that may throw an exception is placed in the try block, and the catch block catches and handles the exception if it occurs. Here's an example:

```java
try {
    int result = divide(10, 0);
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

#### Handling Multiple Exceptions

You can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple catch blocks. Each catch block can handle a specific type of exception. Here's an example:

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw exceptions
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Handle IOException
} catch (SQLException e) {
    // Handle SQLException
}
```

#### Finally Block

The finally block is used to execute code that should always be run, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is commonly used to release resources or perform cleanup operations. Here's an example:

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw exceptions
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exceptions
} finally {
    // Code to be executed regardless of exceptions
}
```

#### Custom Exceptions

Java allows you to create your own custom exceptions by extending the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. Custom exceptions can be used to handle specific scenarios in your code. Here's an example:

```java
public class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

// Usage
try {
    // Code that may throw CustomException
    throw new CustomException("Custom exception occurred");
} catch (CustomException e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

#### Exception Propagation

When an exception is thrown, it can be caught and handled by a method higher up in the call stack or propagated to the calling method. By default, checked exceptions must be declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword if they are not caught and handled. Here's an example:

```java
public void method1() throws IOException {
    method2();
}

public void method2() throws IOException {
    method3();
}

public void method3() throws IOException {
    throw new IOException("Exception occurred");
}

// Usage
try {
    method1();
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
